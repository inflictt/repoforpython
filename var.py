#in python variable are different han other languages like C AND C++
#FOR EXAMPLE - let a =  10 , in phython a bucket will be build and a value which is 10 will get assigned and then 10 will get an address and a act as a tag
#where as in c , same example, bucket will be made of letter a with a address to it and value of 10 will be assigned to it .
# in short , 10 will be assigned an address instead of a getting address.
# due to this pyhton uses value effciently
