# logical opr = used to connect more than one relational opr to form more complex experesssion , eg and or not 
# a= 3
# b=2
# c=1
# print(a>b and b>c)
# print(a>b or b<c)
# print(a<b and b>c)
# print(a<b or b<c)
# print(a>b and c)
# print(a<b or 2931)
# print(not(a>b))
# assignment opr = eg =,+=,-=etc
# a=23 
# a /= 23 
# print(a) 
# bitwise opr = & = bitwise and , | = bitwise or 
# in bitwise when comparing a number the number is first vconverted into a binary number 
# a = 10
# b = 15
# print (a&b)
#membership opr = in and not in
# not in is reverse of in opr
#in = to find an elemeent in an specified sequence ex = st1 = "saksham to inflict"
#print("to " in st1)
#print("too " in st1)
#identity opr =to compare two objects memory locations
#is= check where 2 objrct are on same location or same or not eg 
# a =10  
# b = 10
# print(a is b) 
#is not=   oppostie of is
a =10  
b = 100
print(a is not b)
